This Excel-based data analysis project explores hotel sales transactions across multiple regions to uncover **revenue trends**, **customer behaviour**, and **channel performance**. The project was conducted to support strategic decision-making in pricing, marketing, and operational efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyse hotel sales transaction data and uncover actionable insights around:

- Booking trends by month
- Revenue drivers across regions
- Impact of customer demographics on pricing
- Channel and payment preferences
- Strategic performance of hotel locations

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **March** recorded the **highest number of bookings**, but **July** generated the **highest revenue**, highlighting **pricing inefficiencies** — more bookings ≠ more revenue.
  
- **Lexis Suites** generated the **highest revenue**, largely due to its **city-center location** and a **high-discount strategy**.  
  ↳ *Correlation between discounts and sales: 0.85*

- **Older customers** tend to pay **higher prices**.  
  ↳ *Age vs Price correlation: 0.80*

- **Booking.com** is the dominant reservation platform used by most guests.

- **Credit Card** is the most preferred payment method, likely influenced by Booking.com's requirement for card-based transactions.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Adjust pricing** in high-booking months like March to **maximise revenue** during peak demand.

- **Replicate Lexis Suites’ discount strategy** in other hotels, especially during off-seasons, to drive bookings and increase revenue.

- **Target older demographics** with premium-priced packages and exclusive offerings.

- **Strengthen listings on Booking.com** through better reviews, visuals, and exclusive deals — while also **assessing other platforms** for underperformance or improvement opportunities.

- **Enhance credit card processing** and offer perks (e.g., instant check-in, loyalty points) for card users on Booking.com and similar platforms.
